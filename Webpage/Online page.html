Back in 2007, the American sportswear company's skateboarding division dropped the Nike SB Dunk Low ‘Trail End.’ It sold out within seconds of releasing.</i></p>

It's still left-field, and architectural, and abstract – three unarguable Owens qualities – but it's… kinda Barbiecore.</i></p>

Unlike the aforementioned black and white model, the new sliders take inspiration from the popular (and sold out) Kanye West-designed Yeezy Slides that have been seen on the feet of Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber.</i></p>
